'Droid Inventor Kit' is a kit to create a droid. 

In addition, the droid can be moved with simple programming from a smartphone.

However, there is a problem. 

Currently, [the app has been removed from the store and cannot be installed](https://community.sphero.com/t/droid-inventor-kit-app-gone-from-play-app-store/2783/17).

Therefore, I created code that the droid can be operated from Swift, and provide it.
